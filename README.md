# UnofficialLiveAspNetShowDetailsTestRepo
Just a test repo for experimental storage of contents for show details for live.asp.net

Related to this pull request https://github.com/aspnet/live.asp.net/pull/92, I've created another experimental solution for how the community can contribute show detail contents. The solution can be tested by checking out this branch: https://github.com/eloekset/live.asp.net/tree/showDetailsPage_ContentsInGitRepo

By storing the contents for live.asp.net in a separate GitHub repo, a team of editors/moderators having write access to the repo can take pull requests of contents from the community. Anyone can clone the contents repo, make changes and submit pull requests to help indexing all videos.
